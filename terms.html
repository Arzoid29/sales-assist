                <p>This SalesAssist Terms of Service (the “Agreement”) is between you and SalesAssist, Inc. (“SalesAssist”). If you are agreeing to this Agreement both as an individual and/or on behalf of a specified business that sells products or services (“Business”), then “Customer” or “you” means your Business, and you are binding your Business to this Agreement.</p>

                <p>By selecting the checkbox stating that you agree (or similar) that is presented to you at the time of requesting an account and when signing in, or by using or accessing SalesAssist products, you are agreeing to be bound by all terms, conditions, and notices contained or referenced in this agreement. If you do not agree to this agreement, please do not use any services.</p>
                
                <p class="font-bold text-slate-800 bg-slate-50 p-4 rounded-lg border border-slate-200">FOR CLARITY, EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT THIS AGREEMENT IS LEGALLY BINDING UPON IT. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE THE USE OF ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.</p>

                <h2>1. Scope of the Agreement</h2>
                <p>This Agreement permits Customer to purchase subscriptions to online software-as-a-service products and other services from SalesAssist pursuant to executing any manual or digital SalesAssist ordering documents, online registration, order descriptions, or order confirmations referencing this Agreement (“Order Form(s)”) and sets forth the basic terms and conditions under which those products and services will be delivered. For purposes of this Agreement, an “Order Form” means a SalesAssist-approved ordering document that specifies Customer’s purchase of a subscription to a SalesAssist Solution, paid directly by the Customer or by a sponsoring party. Subject to Customer’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement, including payment by the Customer or the sponsoring party of the applicable Setup Fee and Monthly Subscription Fees (each as defined herein), SalesAssist will provide and make available to the Business and its Authorized Users the SalesAssist Solution(s) to which Customer is subscribed, as set forth on the applicable Order Form(s). Each subscription to a SalesAssist Solution is provided on an individual or “per-branch” basis, meaning that such subscription is specific to, and may only be used for and by, the individual that placed the order or a single Business location identified on the applicable Order Form (the “Business Location”). Any use of or access to the SalesAssist Solution(s) by or for any business location other than the Business Location shall be in violation of this Agreement (irrespective of whether such business location may be owned or otherwise affiliated with Business).</p>

                <h2>2. SalesAssist Solutions</h2>

The SalesAssist Solutions include SalesAssist Essential, for basic sales processes; SalesAssist Advanced, for complex sales processes; SalesAssist Enterprise, which customizes a plan to the needs of the business.</p>
                <p>The SalesAssist Solutions are intended to assist businesses in the completion of their sales by integrating our platform into their existing CRM and their other Systems of Record (“SOR”), so they can complete sales with all our completion tools (eSignatures, eForms, payments, KYC, etc) right from their CRM. The SalesAssist Solutions are not an advisory service and do not recommend or endorse any particular transaction, sales strategy or other approach to managing the sales process or Business’s process generally.</p>
                <p>The SalesAssist Solutions are intended only to facilitate the process by which Businesses complete sales. The SalesAssist Solutions do NOT offer any advice regarding the value, costs, profit targets, quality or suitability of any particular transaction, process or sales strategy. Customer is solely and exclusively responsible for ensuring the accuracy and integrity of any data or information that may be input or otherwise loaded into any SalesAssist Solution. Customer also assumes sole and complete responsibility for any documents, forms, payments and other content and materials that may be generated by or through any SalesAssist Solution (“Generated Content”), and Customer shall ensure the accuracy and completeness of all Generated Content (including any information entered by Customer or their clients in any form, document, contract or any Generated Content) prior to submitting or otherwise making aggregating such Generated Content to any SOR or any third party.</p>

                <h3>2.2. Provision of Solutions</h3>
                <p>Each Solution is provided on a subscription basis for a set term designated on the Order Form (each, a “Subscription Term”). SalesAssist may also offer Professional Services (as defined in Section 11) related to certain Services.</p>

                <h3>2.3. Access to Solutions</h3>
                <p>Customer and its Authorized Users may access and use the Solutions solely for its own benefit and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

                <h3>2.4. License to Solutions</h3>
                <p>To the extent SalesAssist provides SalesAssist Apps for use with the Solutions, subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, SalesAssist grants to Customer and its Authorized Users a limited, non-exclusive and non-transferable right and license to use and access the SalesAssist Solution(s) to which Business is subscribed and any Generated Content (as defined in Section 2.1), in each case solely for the purpose of gathering and sharing information while completing the Business’s sales for the Business Location. The license granted in this Section 2.4 includes access to basic email and chat technical support from SalesAssist with respect to the SalesAssist Solution(s).</p>

                <h3>2.5. Contractors and Affiliates</h3>
                <p>Customer may permit its Contractors and its Affiliates' employees and Contractors to serve as Authorized Users, provided Customer remains responsible for compliance by such individuals with all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and any use of the Services by such individuals is for the sole benefit of Customer.</p>

                <h3>2.6. General Restrictions</h3>

                <h3>2.7. SalesAssist APIs</h3>
                <p>If SalesAssist makes access to any APIs available as part of the SalesAssist Solutions, SalesAssist reserves the right to place limits on access to such APIs (e.g., limits on numbers of calls or requests). Further, SalesAssist may monitor Customer's usage of such APIs and limit the number of calls or requests Customer may make if SalesAssist believes that Customer's usage is in breach of this Agreement or may negatively affect the Services (or otherwise impose liability on SalesAssist).</p>

                <h3>2.8. Trial Subscriptions</h3>
                <p>If Customer receives free access or a trial or evaluation subscription to the Service (a “Trial Subscription”), then Customer may use the Services in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement for a period of thirty (30) days or such other period granted by SalesAssist (the “Trial Period”).
