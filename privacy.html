                <p>At SalesAssist ("SA"), we respect the privacy rights of our users and recognize the importance of protecting the personal information we collect about you. Our Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand what information we collect and how we use and share that information. This Privacy Policy applies to our website, mobile and other online applications and products and services (collectively, the "SA Offerings"). As used in this Privacy Policy, "SA," "us" and "we" refers to SalesAssist Offerings developed by Shipload, Inc. and its affiliate.</p>

                <p>By using SA sites and products, you consent to the use of your information and information about you in accordance with this Privacy Statement. This Privacy Statement is intended for employees and representatives of our business clients. Our website is not intended for use by consumers.</p>

                <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
                
                <p><strong>Registration and Contact Information.</strong> We collect information about you when you (a) register to use the Solutions and (b) otherwise provide contact information to us via email, mail, or through our SA Offerings. This information you provide may include your username, first and last name, email address, mailing address or phone number.</p>

                <p><strong>Payment Information.</strong> When you purchase the Solutions, we will also collect transaction information, which may include your credit card information, billing and mailing address, and other payment-related information ("Payment Information"). We describe how Payment Information may be collected and processed in Section 4.</p>

                <p><strong>Technical, Usage and Location Information.</strong> We automatically collect information on how you interact with the Offerings, such as the IP address from which you access the SA Offerings, date and time, information about your browser, operating system and computer or device, pages viewed and items clicked. We may also collect location information, including location information automatically provided by your computer or device. We use cookies and similar technologies to collect some of this information.</p>

                <p><strong>Third Party Platforms.</strong> We may collect information when you interact with our advertisements and other content on third-party sites or platforms, such as social networking sites. This may include information such as "Likes", profile information gathered from social networking sites or the fact that you viewed or interacted with our content.</p>

                <p><strong>Other Information.</strong> We may collect other information from you that is not specifically listed here. We may use any such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy or as otherwise permitted by you.</p>

                <p><strong>Data Technologies.</strong> Various technologies are used to automatically collect information, such as cookies, local shared objects, and web beacons (generally referred to as "Data Technologies"). "Cookies" are small identifiers sent from a web server that are stored on your device for the purpose of identifying your browser or storing information or settings in your browser. "Local shared objects," sometimes known as Flash cookies, may be used to store your preferences or display content based upon what you have viewed on various websites to personalize your visit. A "web beacon," also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies. Anonymous advertising identifiers are increasingly being used on mobile devices and otherwise in a manner similar to cookies. When we refer to Data Technologies, we are including all current and similar future technologies.</p>

                    <p>We collect and store phone numbers solely for the purpose of providing support, responding to customer inquiries, and notifying you about your support requests.</p>

                <h2>How We Use the Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>We do not sell, trade, share or transfer your personal information to third parties except in the following limited circumstances:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Affiliates.</strong> We may share information about you, including personal information, with our corporate affiliates, who will use it in accordance with their privacy policies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Our Service Providers.</strong> We may engage third parties to provide the services offered through or in connection with the SA Offerings on our behalf. We require such providers to maintain information about you as confidential and to use the information only to perform the services specified by us in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Corporate and Asset Transactions.</strong> If we sell all or substantially all of our business or sell or transfer all or a material part of our assets, or are otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a substantial part of our business, we may transfer all information we have collected and stored, including personal information, to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Other.</strong> We may access or disclose information, including personal information, to: protect or defend our interests and the legal rights or property of SA and our affiliates; protect the rights, interests, safety and security of users of the SA Offerings or members of the public; protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; comply with prudent legal practice as we may determine, and applicable law or legal process; or process your payments, as further described below.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We may also share aggregated or anonymized information with third parties for other purposes. Such information does not identify you individually, but may include usage, viewing and technical information such as the types of SA Offerings our customers and users generally use, the configuration of their computers, and performance metrics related to the use of SA Offerings which we collected through our technology. If we are required under applicable law to treat such information as personal information, then we will only disclose it as described above. Otherwise we may disclose such information for any reason.</p>

                <h2>Payment Information</h2>
                <p>When you make a purchase on the SA Offerings, any credit card information you provide as part of your Payment Information is collected and processed directly by our payment processor Stripe through their Stripe Checkout service. We never receive or store your full credit card information. Stripe commits to complying with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) and using industry standard security. Stripe may use your Payment Information in accordance with their own Privacy Policy here: <a href="https://stripe.com/us/checkout/legal" target="_blank">https://stripe.com/us/checkout/legal</a>.</p>

                <h2>Your Controls and Choices</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Opt-Outs.</strong> We may provide you with the opportunity to "opt-out" of having your personal information used for certain purposes when we ask for this information. If you decide to opt-out, we may not be able to provide certain features of the SA Offerings to you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communication Preferences.</strong> If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included on such communications or on the Offerings. Please note, however, that you may be unable to opt-out of certain service-related communications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Blocking Cookies.</strong> You can remove or block certain cookies using the settings in your browser but the Offerings may cease to function properly if you do so.</li>
                    <li><strong>How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals.</strong> Your Web browser may have a "do not track" setting which, when enabled, causes your browser to send a do not track HTTP header file or "signal" to each site you visit. At present, the Offerings do not respond to this type of signal.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information</h2>
                <p>When you use the SA Offerings, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information upon your request and either provide you the means to correct this information if it is inaccurate or to delete such information at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. You may access, review, correct, update, change or delete your information at any time.</p>
                <p>To do so, please contact us at <a href="mailto:help@salesassist.io">help@salesassist.io</a> with your name and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed, or if you are using one of the SA Solutions, sign in to your account, go to your profile, and make the desired changes.</p>
                <p>We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, would be extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Please note that if you cease using the Solutions or we terminate your access to the Solutions in accordance with your Customer Agreement, you may no longer have the ability to access or update your information.</p>
                <p>We may retain your information as necessary to support the Offerings, comply with our legal obligations or resolve disputes. Note that content you post may remain on the SA Offerings even if you cease using the SA Offerings or we terminate your access to the SA Offerings.</p>

                <h2>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy at any time. If we make changes, we will post them and will indicate on this page the policy's new effective date. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you by email or through notice on the SA Offerings.</p>

                <h2>No Children Under Age 18</h2>
                <p>The Offerings are not intended for use by anyone under the age of 18, nor does SA knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are under 18, you may not attempt to register for the SA Offerings or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. In the event that we confirm that we have collected personal information from someone under the age of 18 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information promptly. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a child under 18 and believe that we might have any information from or about such a child, please contact us at the email or mailing address provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h2>Your California Privacy Rights and Disclosures</h2>
                <p><strong>California Shine the Light Law.</strong> If you are a California resident and we disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties for such third parties' direct marketing purposes, California's Shine the Light Law (CA Civil Code Section 1798.83) allows you to request certain information from us about such disclosures. To make a request under the Shine the Light Law, please contact us at <a href="mailto:help@salesassist.io">help@salesassist.io</a>. Please note that under California law, businesses are not required to respond to such requests more than once during any calendar year.</p>
                <p><strong>California Minors.</strong> At any time, you can delete or remove your posts using the same deletion or removal procedures described in Section 8 (Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information) above, or otherwise through the Offerings. If you have questions about how to remove your posts or if you would like additional assistance with deletion you can contact our support team at <a href="mailto:help@salesassist.io">help@salesassist.io</a>. Although we offer deletion capability for our Offerings, you should be aware that the removal of posts may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information posted through the Offerings.</p>

                <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We maintain a variety of appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to protect your personal information. We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. Further, we have implemented reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to protect personal information about you. When you enter sensitive information (such as your password), we encrypt that information in transit using industry-standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption technology. No method of transmission over the Internet, method of electronic storage or other security methods are one hundred percent secure. Therefore, while we strive to use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

                <h2>International Transfer of Data</h2>
                <p>We may from time to time transfer your personal information to other countries outside the United States and make it accessible to our parents, subsidiaries, affiliates and third party service providers internationally. We will protect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy wherever it is processed.</p>

                <h2>Contact Us</h2>
                <p>If you have questions or need to contact us about this Privacy Policy, please email us at <a href="mailto:help@salesassist.io">help@salesassist.io</a></p>
